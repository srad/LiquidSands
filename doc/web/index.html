    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <i>
    <p> "As salam alaikum.
      I am Abu-Hassan carpet crafter from the faraway city of Jauhir.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my countless journeys I fought the one-eyed cylops of Isle Balor
      and took a deep glance into the mirrors of the oracle of Sumlah. <br>
      In thanks for the rescue of the vizier of the caliph of Jaunir I once
      was the ruler of El-Minah and in the mountains held the tear of a godess
      in my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rest your weary feet, dear traveler, to take a seat right by my side
      and listen to my story. <br>
      ... the story about a land so far away in time and distance,
      that some may claim it never happened, but yet it is true. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen... listen faithfully..."
    </p>
    </i>
    
    <h3> About </h3>
    <p>
      The Liquid Sands will be a turn based strategy game based on different
      units acting on a planer board, divided into hexagonal tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strategic elements of the game will follow two main concepts: fight
      and trade. <br>
      We plan to provide the player with five different units, each with its
      own strengths and weaknesses. <br> Currently we plan to support three
      units mainly dedicated to fighting and two units with transportation
      capabilities, making up for a total of five different units at the
      players disposal. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To allow for some variation in gameplay as well as in strategy
      some tiles, like mountains will be impassable by player units.
    </p>

        <td> <img src="images/jussuf.png"> </td>
        <td valign="top">
          <h4> "Jussuf" the flying carpet </h4>
          <p>
            Every child knows those standard flying rugware devices utilized by hurried merachants 
            to serve their time-pressing business dealings.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he is anyting but one of such low-quality rugware devices, don't ever dare 
            dare to confuse "Jussuf" with one of those.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Jussuf" is a beast that has a soul.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beware of the anger you will pull upon you if he ever finds out you try to compare him 
            to such a lifeless thing as a carpet.
          </p>
          <p>
            His speed and his agility make up for the rather low capacity he is capable to transport.

          <h4> "Kalli" the camel </h4>
          <p>
            Although his best times have already passed by, "Kalli" is still one of the
            most valuable companions you might wish to take along in the desert, 
            unbeaten as well in loyalty as in experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might seem brave "Kalli" is just another camel, like those
            seen on daily markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            But take him with you just for a day and you will see he makes for 
            one of the most priceless friends you can depend on at all costs. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the years "Kalli" has already seen pass by he might have lost some 
            of speed but he will still carry almost any weight you might offer without a moan.

        <td valign="top">
          <h4> Falmingo-lady "Rosa" </h4>
          <p>
            As she originates from the far away lands of Jauq'al-Har,
            "Rosa" might be one of the most exotic birds ever to be seen in the deserts.
          <p>
            Sheik Mussalah-Yissin ibn Salah-Masri al Kwasami brougt her from one
            of his numerous journeys, as she and her sisters were presented him as a gift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't be fooled by her lovely and fragile appearence.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the lightweight design of her body she is one of the fastest and makes one of
            the best scouts you might wish for and her pecker is mighty sharp.

    <h3> Bugs </h3>
    <p>
      Currently we are having a hard time tracking down some slight
      inaccuracies related to animated movement along a given path.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment it seems that these only show up on computers with
      framerates dropping extremely low. <br>
      Unfortunately we will have to investigate this issue further, before
      any bugfix can be attempted.
