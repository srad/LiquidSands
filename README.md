# LiquidSands

This project was part of the Visual Computing internship at the University of Frankfurt, Germany.

* It has been written by three students (one was I) and it was our first game project ever.
* The guideline was to use the jMonkeyEngine Java game engine.
* The game had to be a round based Strategy game on a hexagon field where two players play over a server against each other.
