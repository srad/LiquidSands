# LiquidSands

This project was part of the Visual Computing internship at the University of Frankfurt, Germany.

* Notice that the download might not be available. Then just look in the release folder on github.

Some notes:

* It has been written by three students (one was I) and it was our first game project ever.
* The guideline was to use the jMonkeyEngine Java game engine.
* The game had to be
* a round based Strategy game
* on a hexagon field
* where two players play over a server against each other
* and the maps are provided by the game server and must be generated dynamically by the game
